Hello all
This code is designed to be added to your wordpress functions.php
It adds the following information automatically to the bottom of all your pages and posts
Today's date, the date the page/post was initially published, the date the page/post was last updated
It is not a bloated plugin
It is just code that runs very quickly and keeps your page fresh
